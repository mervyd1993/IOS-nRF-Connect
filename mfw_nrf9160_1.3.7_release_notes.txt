nRF9160 engineering sample SIP versions are not supported. These nRF9160 SIP versions have markings
E2.x.y on top of the SIP package.

nRF9160 SIxA B0A version is supported only for R&D development purposes, not for production.

This release is aligned with v2.2 of nRF91 AT command reference guide.

It is recommended to use the latest version of nRF Connect and nRF Connect Programmer tools.

*** New functionality
*********************
- Added support for modem APDU interface to enable USIM implementation in application domain.
- Feature for requesting a claim token which is a proof of ownership of the device. Feature can be
  utilized with AT command %CLAIMTOKEN.
- Feature for new symmetric key called Asset Encryption Key (AEK). AEK is a possible solution for
  bulk device provision functionality. Feature can be used through AT command %KEYINJECT.

*** Changes
***********
- Improved the LTE positioning accuracy by enabling the reporting of excluded cells in %NCELLMEAS
  results.
- Improved the LTE positioning accuracy by adding support for Global Cell Id (GCI) search in
  %NCELLMEAS results. Cells measured for RRC Idle mobility and other cells from supported bands are
  searched and GCI is reported. Result includes cells of serving PLMN as well as cells from other
  PLMNs.
- Active %XPOFWARN prevents delta FOTA update operation. Feature protects NVM erase and write
  operations with critically low battery voltage.
- Improved the execution time for home PLMN detection and search.
- Updated default MTU value for specific mobile network operator.
- Updated Radio Policy Manager (RPM) default values for specific mobile network operator.

*** Bug fixes
*************
- Fixed the handling of GNSS/LTE co-existence in certain LTE scenarios where ephemeris assistance
  was injected without position assistance. The fix improves position fix availability.
- Fixed the computation of DOP values in poor signal conditions. This may have caused erroneous zero
  DOPs in the RPC and NMEA output.
- Fixed an issue with reporting invalid position fixes. This may have caused RPC PVT notifications
  to contain nonzero position fields even though the position fix was flagged invalid.
- Fixed almanac downloading logic used in periodic position fix mode. This improves almanac
  availability in such situations resulting in some signals being found quicker, thus statistically
  improving TTFF and position fix quality.
- Ephemeris download period reduced for 2 hours to 1 hour in period positioning fix more, resulting
  in better ephemeris availability and thus better accuracy.
- Fixed issues in almanac validity period management. In periodic positioning fix mode, the receiver
  would try to download almanacs unnecessarily in certain situations, and request AGPS almanacs
  unnecessarily in others.
- Enhanced fix quality management, reducing position outliers and enhancing position fix quality in
  very poor signal strength and visibility conditions.
- Improved the reliability of data transmission from modem subsystem towards application processor.
- Improved UICC ATR reception to fast recover from random reception errors.
- Fixed an issue where UICC was not polled after resumed from suspension. On some occasions the
  device might have missed a proactive command from UICC.
- Fixed an issue where location information object was incorrectly included to location status event
  when device was in limited-service state.
- Fixed an issue where NB-IoT receiver did not always enter the lowest possible power state during
  short idle periods causing slightly increased power consumption.
- Fixed an issue, where TCP timer was left running in subsequent PSM sleeps. This caused unnecessary
  wakeups to modem subsystem.
- Fixed an issue where TCP RST was not always properly sent. As a result, this had negative impact
  to power efficiency because of TCP re-transmissions by other peer to closed session.
- Fixed an issue where incorrect access technology type was returned when eDRX parameters were read
  with +CEDRXRDP. Modem returned the access technology type in which the eDRX was negotiated even
  though currently camped cell did not support eDRX.
- Fixed an issue where UE activated PSM even there was a need to initiate TAU procedure for
  signaling connection recovery.
- Fixed an issue due to which APN rate control was not always followed.
- Fixed an issue due to which EPS bearer context status information element was incorrectly built-in
  certain scenario. This caused confusion and extra signaling between UE and network.
- Fixed an issue where mobile network operator specific default PTW value was not used.
- Fixed an issue where modem did not correctly indicate that only IPv4 is allowed to be used in
  current network.
- Fixed an issue where PDN connection reactivation and client initiated PDN disconnect procedure

*** Bug fixes
*************
- Fixed GNSS instability during LTE mode. This rare issue may have been observed after around 60
  seconds from the previous last good fix.
- Fixed an issue where modem does not recover from PDN close procedure. In case of modem’s uplink
  data buffers are full and PDN connection is closed, the modem may not have recovered without power
  cycle.
- Improved reliability of SIM refresh procedure during connection setup. In rare cases of
  simultaneous SIM refresh and connection establishment, the modem may not have recovered without
  deactivation.
- Fixed a bug in PSM sleep conditions. In certain scenario modem went into PSM sleep even it was not
  allowed to do so due to pending modem procedures. Also, a bug in CEREG notification related to
  this scenario was fixed.
- Fixed a crossover scenario of Service Request and cell lost during GNSS tracking. With unsuitable
  timing it was possible that modem was blocked and was not able to continue normal operation.
- AS Release Assistance Indicator feature updated after it was seen that some networks may release
  RRC connection even during PDN Connection Activation causing the procedure to fail.
- Fixed unstable modem operation in multimode use cases where system mode changes after forbidden
  tracking area.
- NB-IoT HARQ ACK transmission for MSG4 may fail in some CE level 2 configurations causing a failure
  in connection establishment.

28 and 66.

This release is aligned with v1.4 of nRF91 AT command reference guide.

It is recommended to use the latest version of nRF Connect and nRF Connect Programmer tools.

*** New functionality
*********************
- Support for new module nRF9160-SIxA-B1 including nPM6000 support and quiescent current consumption
  reduction on PWR OFF mode.
- Added AT%XPDNCFG support for always-on initial PDN connection. With this feature configured, modem
  will try to keep the initial PDN connection (activated during Attach procedure) alive until PDN
  connection or modem deactivation is requested by the client. Keeping the initial PDN connection
  alive means that PDN connection re-activation is attempted and even re-Attached if re-activation
  does not help.
- Added AT command AT%BSKGEN and AT%BSKCHCK support for generating and storing PSK key for bootstrap
  type of services.
- Added AT command AT%XPOFWARN for configuring and setting voltage levels for modem deactivation and
  power off warning indication when battery voltage is running low.
- Added support for TLS extension Server Name Indication (SNI).
- Added support for (D)TLS cache over power cycle.
- Added support of burst (discontinuous) mode TX to AT%XRFTEST to better support synching to various
  testing equipment.
- Added support of handling of relative frequency error for the AFC testing of AT%XRFTEST.
- Added support for 3GPP 36.509 defined Test Loop H.

*** Changes
***********
- E-UTRA Cat-M1 Band 17 support removed.
- Updated the contents of carrier specific EF-Terminal Support Table based on latest specification.
- Changed and improved completing of Control Plane Service Request procedures. Change improves
  scenarios where REL14 level network sends security protected PDUs to UE.
- Radio Link Monitoring and Radio Link Failure IN-SYNC and OUT-SYNC threshold values adjusted for
  more robust mobility performance.
- Changed carrier specific band configurations. Configured based on UICC in use.
- Finetuned RSRP, RSRQ and SNR values reported with AT command interface. RSRP and RSRQ and SNR are
  filtered over DRX cycles corresponding approximately the length of 6 seconds.
- Changed AT%XRFTEST Tx test CW offset as follows: M1 401.25 kHz, NB1 48.75 (was 255 kHz for both).
- AT%XRFTEST sensor test with <param0> = 1 now returns the SoC internal temperature sensor reading.

*** Bug fixes
*************
- Correction for handling FOTA rollback in case of security or watchdog reset. In case if FOTA
  delta binary is still available in the device and security or watchdog reset triggered, it caused
  unintentional modem firmware rollback.
- Correction for a rare scenario where UE initiated detach request transmission was internally
  blocked and UE was not able to signal switch-off Detach to network.
- Correction to ensure that UICC polling timer is restarted correctly after presence detection is
  stopped.
- Correction to background PLMN search in RRC IDLE. If manual PLMN search is triggered when paging
  reception is about to start it may cause performance degradation for paging reception.
- Correction for a rare occasion where UE was jammed if switch-off (AT+CFUN=4) was triggered during
  recently started Attach procedure.
- Correction for registration status indication to AT clients: During Airplane mode the status shall
  be only “not registered” instead of “not registered - trying”.
- Correction for EMM functionality so that T3440 is stopped at the reception of ESM DATA TRANSPORT.
  This enables UE to send uplink PDUs again and there will be less buffered UL data.
- Corrected the conditions for sending EVENT DOWNLOAD (Location Status - Normal Service) from USAT
  module to UICC.
- Correction for the use case where re-Attach triggered by protocol failed in case APN was
  configured for the initial PDN connection.
- Correction to USIM refresh handling during user data transfer.
- Minor Rx gain performance improvement during neighbor measurement and search in EMTC-M1 to improve
  cell search performance.
- Correction for a scenario where USIM card was removed while UE was in PSM. UE failed to camp on
  cell and signal Detach Request in this case.
- Trace configuration corrected, NB-IoT PRACH logging objects were not visible in modem logs.
- Correction for NB-IoT neighbor measurements, which may have caused that occasionally not the most
  suitable cell was selected after connection release.
- NB-IoT stability and performance improvements when invalid downlink subframe configurations are
  configured from network.
- Correction for PVT message handling. GNSS blocked by LTE flag is not properly set beyond fix
  retry period.
- Correction for AGPS / GNSS flash file storage handling, improving robustness of the periodic fix
  after AGPS is used for a start.
- Correction for clock calibration control which may have delayed deep sleep entry in combined
  NB-IoT and GNSS tracking mode and may slightly increase power consumption.
- Correction for handover functionality in shared RAN environment. In some occasional cases
  unintentional TAU was transmitted after handover.
- Correction for halt caused by crossover scenario of LTE registration and de-registration. Attach
  abnormal case F.
- Correction for modem instability in case if eligible system information is not scheduled in
  current cell.
- Improved stability is case of concurrent MT and MO data triggered. If both MT data from network
  and MO data from application are triggered at the same time this may occasionally lead to a modem
  reset.
- Correction for PTW re-setting to manufacturer default values when using AT%XPTW command. Earlier
  zero values were set instead of defaults.
- Correction for potential SIB-NB reception instability and performance in networks supporting new
  3GPP Release 14 NB-IoT system information blocks.
- Correction for possible Handover failure in RRC Connected mode to target cell when target
  neighbor is already found in RRC Idle mode and measured and reported in RRC Connected mode.
- Correction for serving cell Srxlev and Srxqual in Cat-M1 cell selection and reselection criteria
  to be independent of amount of repetitions in P-RNTI monitoring.
- Correction for handling crossover of File Change Notification (FCN) type of SIM refresh and Attach
  procedure. With certain timings and conditions, UE found a cell and camped on it while SIM refresh
  was still ongoing. This crossover was not always handled properly and RRC connection establishment
  for Attach procedure was not triggered correctly.

*** Limitations
***************
- TLS/DTLS
    - Up to three simultaneous TLS/DTLS connections are possible.
    - Server certificate expiry time is not verified.
    - pkcs#8 is not supported.
    - Absolute maximum number of supported credentials is 32. The actual amount depends on size of
      credentials as memory area reserved for credentials may be a limiting factor as well.
    - DTLS supports PSK authentication only.
    - 2kB secure socket buffer size.
- Maximum number of raw sockets is 4.
- User plane data is supported in Cat M1 mode only.
